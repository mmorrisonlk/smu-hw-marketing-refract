1st Homework Assignment Refracting Marketing Site

For this assignment I decided to focus on two areas for improvement. One was the addition of alt text for the images on the webpage. The second was to remove repetative classes and definitions for those classes. I made broadly named classes as opposed to the specific classes the previous website version used because the classes were defining the same style settings each time. I used additional selectors to further modify the style for img elements and the like without the creation of entirely new classes.

I also tested myself by redoing the header into a flex box with some conditional media styling. I realized after doing this that it wasn't really required by the assignment but didn't remove it because I was proud of the code. I also noted in the commenting that it lays the groundwork that could be applied to the whole site to make it work dynamically with different device dimensions.
